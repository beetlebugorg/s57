# S-57 Parser for Go

A pure Go parser for IHO S-57 Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) files, the international standard for digital hydrographic data used worldwide in maritime navigation.

:::caution Learning Project

**This is a personal learning project with two primary goals:**

1. **Exploring AI-assisted development** - Pushing the boundaries of what AI coding agents can accomplish with complex technical standards
2. **Learning marine digital chart technology** - Deep dive into ISO 8211, S-57 ENC, and S-52 presentation standards

This library was developed using an **AI-first, specification-driven** methodology where every feature is implemented by first analyzing official specifications, then generating idiomatic Go code.

**Key characteristics:**
- ü§ñ **AI-generated code** with human oversight
- üìã **Specification-first** - Every decision traceable to standards
- ‚úÖ **Learning-focused** - Prioritizes understanding over production readiness
- üß™ **Experimental** - Exploring AI capabilities with complex standards

**‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Notice:** While the code aims for quality and correctness, this is **not production-ready navigation software**. It's a learning vehicle for understanding both marine chart formats and AI-assisted development. **Do not use for actual marine navigation or safety-critical applications.**

## What is S-57?

S-57 is the data transfer standard developed by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) for digital hydrographic data. It's used globally for Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) in maritime navigation systems (ECDIS).

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Full IHO S-57 Edition 3.1 compliance**
- ‚úÖ **Parse all S-57 feature types** - Depth contours, buoys, lights, wrecks, and more
- ‚úÖ **Complete spatial topology** - Points, lines, and polygons with proper geometry construction
- ‚úÖ **Automatic update merging** - Handles .001, .002, etc. update files automatically
- ‚úÖ **High performance** - R-tree spatial indexing for fast viewport queries
- ‚úÖ **Pure Go** - Zero unsafe code, comprehensive test coverage

## Use Cases

This parser is ideal for:

- **Maritime Navigation Software** - Build chart plotters and ECDIS systems
- **GIS Applications** - Work with official hydrographic data
- **Maritime Research** - Analyze bathymetry, hazards, and navigation features
- **Chart Conversion** - Transform S-57 data to other formats

## How It Works

```go
// 1. Create parser
parser := s57.NewParser()

// 2. Parse ENC file (automatically applies updates)
chart, err := parser.Parse("US5MA22M.000")

// 3. Query features in a viewport
bounds := s57.Bounds{
    MinLon: -71.1, MaxLon: -71.0,
    MinLat: 42.3, MaxLat: 42.4,
}
features := chart.FeaturesInBounds(bounds)

// 4. Render or analyze features
for _, feature := range features {
    fmt.Printf("%s: %v\n", feature.ObjectClass, feature.Geometry)
}
```

## S-57 Data Structure

S-57 charts contain:

- **Feature Objects** - Navigation features like buoys, lights, depth areas
- **Spatial Objects** - Geometric primitives (nodes, edges, faces)
- **Attributes** - Descriptive data (depth values, colors, names)
- **Topology** - Relationships between spatial elements

The parser automatically:
- Builds complete geometries from spatial primitives
- Links features to their geometry
- Applies coordinate transformations
- Handles update files (INSERT/DELETE/MODIFY operations)
